# PAT Audio Technician (PAT)
PAT is a Python library used to play audio files. If you have audio files and want to play them using 
Python, PAT the Audio Technician is at your service.

## How does it work?
PAT uses ffmpeg for audio decoding and resampling. SDL is used to play audio using the sound card. 
Everything is written in C, but the Python C Extension interface allows PAT to be used through the 
CPython interpreter.

## How do I use it?
PAT is currently under very active development. Instructions will be added once the minimum viable 
product is available.
